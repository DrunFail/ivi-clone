It is very difficult to clearly determine where the biopic ends and another movie genre begins. The biography film originated as a subgenre of historical cinema, and over time absorbed elements of drama, comedy, science fiction, musical, thriller, action and other directions. The biopic is not always absolutely reliable: for entertainment, directors often resort to fiction."

      "description": "The best detective films attract viewers with the seemingly mundane plot and setting. There may not be unusual special effects here. There are no scenes of stormy battles, when one extremely pumped-up hero, with only a pistol in his hands, the cartridges in which somehow miraculously do not end, easily deals with a gang of scoundrels armed to the teeth. Online detectives are as close as possible to real life. This is what they attract the attention of fans to strain their convolutions and, together with detectives, find the criminal. If you like a complicated plot, if you want to «move the convolutions» together with the main characters of the picture, then detectives will definitely appeal to you. Detective films are able to so captivate the viewer and plunge him into the abyss of events that in search of a solution to a confusing incident, you can forget about time and feel like part of a world so different from the daily routine."

      "description": "The noir genre has long been one of the most fascinating styles of filmmaking in the history of cinema. But what kind of genre is noir? The answer to this question is not as simple as it would be with science fiction, fantasy, romantic comedies or other popular genres of cinema. Noir is more a style than a genre, and that is why it is not limited to one category of cinema. It is difficult to determine which film exactly fits this style. Film critics attribute the classic fifties film Sunset Boulevard to noir, and one of the most respected films of all time is Casablanca. There's also a lot of controversy surrounding modern favorites like Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy."

However, this is not so at all, because in these 15-20 minutes you need to fit the story, the experiences of the characters, their thoughts and actions, give the viewer food for thought and bring out the main idea for which the film was shot. Sometimes the topics covered in film miniatures are so complex and extensive that you can't help wondering how directors decide to take on these topics at all."
